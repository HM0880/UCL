Useful Coding Lines
===================

Short yet useful lines of code (and some explanations of how they work and/or why they are useful) for various languages.

[Technical Details](https://github.com/HM0880/UCL/blob/master/technical_details.rst) walks the user through setting up a Python, Anaconda, and Mercurial environment.  On August 10, 2015, I started documenting my workflow at Rochester Precision Optics from not only a programmatic/software standpoint (which is included here) but also a comprehensive documentation of the metrology calculations, testing requirements, and past manufacturing engineering work/reasoning/decisions (proprietary information, so not included here).

I started this project on November 1, 2014, because I reuse the same lines of code over and over in my work, and I got tired of either (1) digging around in old files to find what I did long ago or (2) re-Googling what I wanted to do or (3) both.  Heh.
