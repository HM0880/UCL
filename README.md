Useful Coding Lines
===================

Short yet useful lines of code (and some explainations of how they work and/or why they are useful) for MATLAB, LaTeX, Excel, RegEx, and Mathematica.

I started this project on November 1, 2014, because I reuse the same lines of code over and over in my work, and I got tired of either (1) digging around in old files to find what I did long ago or (2) re-Googling what I wanted to do or (3) both.  Heh.
