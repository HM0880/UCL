Useful Coding Lines
===================

Short yet useful lines of code for MATLAB, LaTeX, Excel, and Mathematica.  ("UCL" is an abbreviation of "Useful Coding Lines.")

I started this project because I reuse the same lines of code over and over in my work, and I got tired of either (1) digging around in old files to find what I did long ago or (2) re-Googling what I wanted to do.
